# Certificate Rotation Architecture

## TL;DR

**Certificate rotation in OpenShift is a shared responsibility between library-go and operators/components:**

1. **library-go certrotation package** provides the **core rotation logic** (80% rule, timing calculations, certificate generation)
2. **Operators/Components** are responsible for **integrating** library-go and **running the rotation controllers**
3. **No manual intervention** is required - rotation is fully automated once properly integrated

## The Two-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: library-go certrotation (Core Logic)

**Location**: `github.com/openshift/library-go/pkg/operator/certrotation`

**Responsibility**: Provides the **universal rotation framework** that all OpenShift components use.

**Key Components**:

1. **`RotatedSigningCASecret`** - Manages signing CA rotation
   - Implements the 80% validity threshold check
   - Generates new signing CAs when needed
   - Stores certificates in secrets with proper annotations

2. **`RotatedSelfSignedCertKeySecret`** - Manages target certificate rotation
   - Implements the 80% validity threshold check for target certs
   - Generates new certificates signed by the signing CA
   - Handles CA bundle updates

**Core Rotation Logic** (from `signer.go:168-179`):
```go
func needNewSigningCertKeyPair(secret *corev1.Secret, refresh time.Duration, refreshOnlyWhenExpired bool) (bool, string) {
    // ... validation checks ...
    
    validity := notAfter.Sub(notBefore)
    at80Percent := notAfter.Add(-validity / 5)  // 80% of validity
    if time.Now().After(at80Percent) {
        return true, fmt.Sprintf("past refresh time (80%% of validity): %v", at80Percent)
    }
    
    return false, ""
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Universal 80% rule**: All certificates rotate when 1/5th (20%) of validity remains
- ✅ **Automatic timing**: Calculates rotation time based on certificate validity
- ✅ **Certificate generation**: Creates new certificates with proper cryptographic properties
- ✅ **Annotation management**: Adds TLS metadata annotations automatically
- ✅ **CA bundle management**: Maintains CA bundles with all valid certificates

### Layer 2: Operators/Components (Integration & Execution)

**Responsibility**: Each operator/component **integrates** library-go and **runs** the rotation controllers.

**What Operators Must Do**:

1. **Import library-go certrotation**
2. **Create rotation controllers** using library-go types
3. **Configure validity periods** (e.g., 2 years for Service-CA, 1 year for OCM)
4. **Set resync intervals** (e.g., 2 hours for Service-CA, 10 minutes for OCM)
5. **Run controllers** in their operator's control loop

## Service-CA Rotation: How It Works

### Architecture

```
Service-CA Operator
    │
    ├── Uses library-go certrotation
    │   ├── RotatedSigningCASecret (for Service-CA itself)
    │   └── RotatedSelfSignedCertKeySecret (for target certificates)
    │
    └── Controller runs every 2 hours
        └── Checks if certificates need rotation (80% rule)
            └── If yes, library-go generates new certificates
```

### Code Flow

1. **Service-CA Operator** (`openshift/service-ca-operator`):
   - Imports `github.com/openshift/library-go/pkg/operator/certrotation`
   - Creates a controller that uses `RotatedSigningCASecret` and `RotatedSelfSignedCertKeySecret`
   - Configures: 2-year validity, 2-hour resync interval

2. **Controller Execution**:
   - Every 2 hours, the controller's `sync()` function runs
   - Calls `EnsureSigningCertKeyPair()` from library-go
   - Library-go checks: "Is certificate at 80% of validity?"
   - If yes: Library-go generates new certificate
   - If no: Library-go returns existing certificate

3. **Automatic Rotation**:
   - **No operator code needed** for the rotation logic itself
   - Library-go handles all timing, generation, and storage
   - Operator just needs to call the library functions

### Example: Service-CA Operator Integration

```go
// Service-CA Operator creates rotation controller
func NewServingCertController(...) factory.Controller {
    // Configure rotation using library-go
    signingRotation := certrotation.RotatedSigningCASecret{
        Namespace: namespace,
        Name:      "signing-key",
        Validity:  time.Hour * 24 * 365 * 2,  // 2 years
        Refresh:   time.Hour * 24 * 365 * 2,   // 2 years
        Informer:  secretInformer,
        Lister:    secretInformer.Lister(),
        Client:    kubeClient.CoreV1(),
    }
    
    // Controller runs every 2 hours
    return factory.New().
        ResyncEvery(time.Hour * 2).
        WithSync(func(ctx context.Context, syncCtx factory.SyncContext) error {
            // Library-go handles all rotation logic
            ca, _, err := signingRotation.EnsureSigningCertKeyPair(ctx)
            return err
        }).
        ToController("ServingCertController", recorder)
}
```

**Key Point**: The Service-CA operator doesn't implement rotation logic - it just **uses** library-go's rotation functions.

## Platform-CA Rotation: How It Works

### Architecture

```
Platform Operators (etcd, kube-apiserver, etc.)
    │
    ├── Each operator uses library-go certrotation
    │   ├── RotatedSigningCASecret (for their signing CA)
    │   └── RotatedSelfSignedCertKeySecret (for their target certs)
    │
    └── Each operator runs its own controller
        └── Uses same library-go rotation logic
```

### Example: Etcd Operator

1. **Etcd Operator** creates rotation controllers for:
   - `etcd-signer` (signing CA)
   - `etcd-peer` (target certificate)
   - `etcd-serving` (target certificate)

2. **Each uses library-go**:
   ```go
   signingRotation := certrotation.RotatedSigningCASecret{
       Namespace: "openshift-etcd",
       Name:      "etcd-signer",
       Validity:  time.Hour * 24 * 365 * 2,  // 2 years
       // ... other config ...
   }
   ```

3. **Library-go handles rotation**:
   - Operator calls `EnsureSigningCertKeyPair()`
   - Library-go checks 80% rule
   - Library-go generates new certificate if needed
   - Operator doesn't need to know rotation details

## Open Cluster Management (OCM) Example

### Real Code from OCM

From `certrotation_controller.go:32-38`:
```go
// Follow the rules below to set the value of SigningCertValidity/TargetCertValidity/ResyncInterval:
//
// 1) SigningCertValidity * 1/5 * 1/5 > ResyncInterval * 2
// 2) TargetCertValidity * 1/5 > ResyncInterval * 2
var SigningCertValidity = time.Hour * 24 * 365  // 1 year
var TargetCertValidity = time.Hour * 24 * 30    // 30 days
var ResyncInterval = time.Minute * 10           // 10 minutes
```

**What OCM Does**:
1. **Configures validity periods** (1 year for CA, 30 days for targets)
2. **Sets resync interval** (10 minutes)
3. **Uses library-go** to create rotation objects:
   ```go
   signingRotation := certrotation.SigningRotation{
       Namespace:        clustermanagerNamespace,
       Name:             helpers.SignerSecret,
       Validity:         SigningCertValidity,  // 1 year
       // ... other config ...
   }
   ```

4. **Calls library-go functions**:
   ```go
   signingCertKeyPair, err := rotations.signingRotation.EnsureSigningCertKeyPair()
   ```

**What OCM Doesn't Do**:
- ❌ Implement rotation timing logic (library-go does this)
- ❌ Calculate 80% threshold (library-go does this)
- ❌ Generate certificates (library-go does this)
- ❌ Manage CA bundles (library-go does this)

## FAQ

### Q: Is the owner of the operator or component responsible for creating the rotation routine?

**A: Partially - they integrate library-go, but don't write rotation logic**

- **Operators/Components are responsible for**:
  - ✅ Importing library-go certrotation
  - ✅ Creating rotation controller objects
  - ✅ Configuring validity periods and resync intervals
  - ✅ Running controllers in their control loop
  - ✅ Calling library-go's `EnsureSigningCertKeyPair()` and `EnsureTargetCertKeyPair()`

- **Operators/Components are NOT responsible for**:
  - ❌ Implementing the 80% rotation rule (library-go does this)
  - ❌ Calculating rotation timing (library-go does this)
  - ❌ Generating certificates (library-go does this)
  - ❌ Managing CA bundles (library-go does this)

### Q: Is this part of library-go?

**A: Yes - the core rotation logic is entirely in library-go**

The `github.com/openshift/library-go/pkg/operator/certrotation` package provides:
- ✅ Universal rotation framework
- ✅ 80% validity threshold logic
- ✅ Certificate generation
- ✅ CA bundle management
- ✅ Annotation management
- ✅ Timing calculations

### Q: Is there automation within an OpenShift component taking care of it?

**A: Yes - but it's a combination of library-go + operator integration**

**The Automation Stack**:

1. **library-go certrotation** (Core automation):
   - Provides rotation functions
   - Implements 80% rule
   - Generates certificates automatically

2. **Operators** (Integration layer):
   - Create controllers using library-go
   - Run controllers in control loops
   - Configure validity periods

3. **Controller Framework** (Execution):
   - `factory.New()` creates controllers
   - `ResyncEvery()` sets check intervals
   - Controllers run automatically

**Result**: Fully automated rotation - no manual intervention needed once properly integrated.

### Q: How does the refresh period annotation relate to actual certificate rotation?

**A: The annotation is metadata for TLS Registry compliance, not the rotation mechanism itself**

**Important Distinction**:

1. **Actual Rotation** (handled by library-go):
   - ✅ Rotation happens via library-go's 80% rule logic
   - ✅ Works automatically when using `RotatedSigningCASecret` or `RotatedSelfSignedCertKeySecret`
   - ✅ **Does NOT require the annotation** - rotation is independent of metadata

2. **Refresh Period Annotation** (TLS Registry requirement):
   - 📋 `certificates.openshift.io/refresh-period` is metadata for OpenShift's TLS Registry
   - 📋 Indicates the operator's **commitment** that rotation is tested and working
   - 📋 Library-go **automatically adds** this annotation IF the operator passes `refresh` in `AdditionalAnnotations`
   - 📋 **Missing annotation = TLS Registry violation**, but rotation still works

**How library-go adds the annotation** (from `signer.go:251` and `target.go:290`):
```go
tlsAnnotations.RefreshPeriod = refresh.String()  // Set from operator's refresh config
_ = tlsAnnotations.EnsureTLSMetadataUpdate(&secret.ObjectMeta)  // Adds annotation
```

**The annotation is only added if**:
- The operator passes a `refresh` duration to library-go's rotation struct
- The `AdditionalAnnotations.RefreshPeriod` field is populated

**Key Point**: You can use library-go to rotate certificates properly, but if you don't configure the `refresh` period in `AdditionalAnnotations`, the annotation won't be added. This means:
- ✅ **Rotation still works** (library-go's 80% rule handles it)
- ❌ **TLS Registry requirement not met** (annotation missing)
- ⚠️ **CI tests may fail** (violation tracking in `tls/violations/refresh-period/`)

**Best Practice**: Always configure `AdditionalAnnotations.RefreshPeriod` when using library-go to meet TLS Registry requirements, even though rotation works without it.

### Q: Why does the refresh period annotation exist if rotation works without it?

**A: It's a commitment/assertion system for tracking verified rotation, not proof of CI**

The annotation serves as a **certification** that the operator team has verified rotation works. According to the requirement definition, adding the annotation means you have:

1. ✅ **Manually tested** that rotation works, OR seen someone else test it, **AND**
2. ✅ **Written an automated e2e test** that is blocking GA criteria, **AND/OR** QE has required a test every release, **AND**
3. ✅ **Linked to a test name annotation** (`certificates.openshift.io/test-name`) that identifies the verifying test

**Purpose of the Annotation**:

- 📋 **Trust-based tracking**: Identifies which certificates have been verified to rotate properly
- 📋 **Operator commitment**: The operator team is asserting "we've tested this and it works"
- 📋 **Visibility**: Provides a registry of "certified" auto-rotating certificates
- 📋 **Compliance tracking**: Enables violation detection for untested certificates
- 📋 **CI enforcement**: PRs adding certificates without annotations fail CI (violation regression test)

**Important**: The annotation is **not automatically verified** - it's a **promise** by the operator team. However:
- ✅ Ideally backed by e2e tests (blocking GA or QE-required)
- ✅ Should have a linked `test-name` annotation
- ✅ CI will fail if violations increase (prevents regressions)

**Current Status**: Only 41 out of 275+ certificates have the annotation, indicating this is a newer requirement that operators are gradually adopting.

**Bottom Line**: The annotation exists to track which certificates have been **verified and tested** to rotate, creating a registry of "certified" auto-rotating certificates. It's a commitment system, not proof of CI, though it should ideally be backed by tests.

## Key Takeaways

1. **library-go provides the rotation logic** - operators don't implement it themselves
2. **Operators integrate library-go** - they create controllers and call library functions
3. **Rotation is fully automated** - once integrated, no manual steps required
4. **Universal 80% rule** - all certificates rotate at the same threshold (1/5th of validity remaining)
5. **Consistent across OpenShift** - Service-CA, Platform-CA, and all operators use the same library
